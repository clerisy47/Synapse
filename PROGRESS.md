# PROGRESS.md — Synapse

## Current focus

Next PLAN tasks (unblocked): **M1-T13 (∥C)** (Obsidian storage; needs T04+T07) · **M1-T14 (∥D)** (status bar; needs T11) · **M1-T15** still needs T12+T13 (T12 DONE).

Provider stance: **Phase A = OpenRouter free models**; **Phase B = Ollama only after feature-complete** (SPEC §0 / ADR-21).

## Last session

- Completed **M1-T12**: `createEndpointPolicy` (Phase A OpenRouter host allowlist; Phase B loopback + `endpointAckHost` stub; `assertAllowed` → `TransportError` blocked; egress-warning helper) and `createExclusionPolicy` (folder/tag/frontmatter, fail-closed on null metadata, PDF folder-only).
- Policy stays pure; frontmatter key / host list injected (no `constants` import). Composition / transport wiring deferred to M1-T16.
- Verified local gate: typecheck → lint → boundaries → network/writes/schema → test → build.

## Known issues

- `.env` previously had a trailing space in the key name and quoted value — normalized; keep `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...` unquoted.
- `openrouter/free` can route to thinking-heavy models; prefer pinned `:free` IDs for schema work.
- `npm run lint` targets `src` only; run `npx eslint src test` until the script includes `test/`.

## Shortcuts taken

- DESIGN §5.6 / §8 / §11 and PLAN M1 tasks updated in place rather than a full line-by-line pass of every Ollama mention in DESIGN §6–§13 flows.
- M1-T04 adds a small `createObservable` + `TransportError` class beyond the DESIGN interface snippets so later stores/fakes have a usable pure primitive and `instanceof` mapping.
- Tightened `check-no-writes.mjs` vault patterns to `\bvault\.(modify|create|…)` so `Set.delete` / similar are not false positives.
- M1-T05 uses a hand-rolled subset emitter instead of Zod’s `toJSONSchema` so nullable objects never emit `anyOf` (Zod 4’s default for `.nullable()` on objects).
- M1-T06 uses explicit clamp/fallback helpers rather than zod `.catch` so out-of-range ints clamp instead of resetting to defaults.
- Tightened `check-no-network.mjs` `requestUrl` pattern to `\brequestUrl\s*\(` so the §4.5 transport-mode enum string is not a false positive.
- M1-T07 injects optional `schedule` for debounce (defaults to `window` timers) so vitest can run without a DOM `window`; touch-log hygiene deferred until vault/policy exist.
- M1-T08 kept temporary `ModelPort` types in `scripted-model.ts` until M1-T10; ring-buffer logger is a fake (production `ConsoleSink` still later).
- M1-T09 injects optional `checkEndpoint` instead of importing `policy` (adapters may only depend on `core`); EndpointPolicy wiring lands with M1-T12 / composition root. Disabled Obsidian window-timer lint rules for `adapters/node` and `test/` because Node timers are correct there.
- M1-T10: optional `headers` on `Transport`; `llm-deps` may import `src/constants.ts` (same as config/state) for timeouts / `NUM_PREDICT` / `PLUGIN_NAME`. Auth/rate-limit map to `MODEL_HTTP_ERROR` + remediation keys (no new `ErrorCode`s). Composition root / settings UI wiring deferred to M1-T16.
- M1-T11: `createJobQueue({ clock, abortable })` injects abortability (composition root will pass `transport.capabilities.abortable`); `progress()` stores last stage only (status-bar UI is M1-T14).

## Decisions not in DESIGN.md

- None outstanding (ADR-21 landed in DESIGN).

## Rules to add to AGENTS.md

- (cleared — Phase A/B rules already in AGENTS.md)
